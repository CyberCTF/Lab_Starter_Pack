# Docker and Application Testing Framework
 
## Test Requirements
 
Create focused pytest tests to validate Docker container functionality and basic application operations.
 
### Test Coverage
 
- **Docker Container Tests**: Verify containers are running and accessible
- **Service Availability**: Test that all required services are up and responding
- **Application Functionality**: Basic application features work correctly
- **Port Configuration**: Verify all required ports are open and accessible
- **Database Connectivity**: Test database connections and basic operations
 
### Test Structure
 
#### Test Categories
 
- **Docker Tests**: Container status, health checks, port accessibility
- **Service Tests**: Web application, database, and other services availability
- **Application Tests**: Basic functionality, user interface, API endpoints
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end application workflow
 
#### Test Requirements
 
- **Focused Coverage**: Essential Docker and application functionality
- **Deterministic Results**: Tests must be repeatable and reliable
- **Clear Assertions**: Test names and assertions should be self-documenting
- **Fast Execution**: Quick feedback on Docker and application status
 
### Test Execution
 
- **Run all tests**: Execute complete test suite
- **Docker-specific tests**: Run only Docker container tests
- **Application tests**: Run only application functionality tests
- **Verbose output**: Detailed test execution information
 
### Test Retry and Error Correction
 
#### Configuration (ZERO hardcoded values)
 
- Retry delay: Configurable via `RETRY_DELAY` environment variable (in seconds, defaults to 10 if not set)
- Maximum retries: Configurable via `MAX_RETRIES` environment variable (defaults to 5 if not set)
- Clear display of retry count (e.g., "X tries used")
 
#### Retry Implementation
 
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Tests retry with exponential backoff
- **Environment Configuration**: Retry delay and max retries configurable via environment variables
- **Error Analysis**: Automatic error correction between retry attempts
- **Status Tracking**: Clear display of retry count and test status
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All configuration from environment variables
 
#### Key behaviors
 
- Configurable retry limits (not infinite)
- All configuration from environment variables
- ZERO hardcoded values (no retry limits, no delays)
- Tests retry until they pass or max retries reached
- Automatic error correction between attempts
- Status tracking: "PASSED" or "FAILED" with retry count
 
#### Configuration Examples
 
- **Retry configuration**: Set `RETRY_DELAY=5` and `MAX_RETRIES=3` environment variables
- **Inline configuration**: Set environment variables inline with test execution
- **Default behavior**: Run without configuration (uses default 10s delay, 5 max retries)
 
#### How It Works
 
- **No Environment Variables Set**: Uses default 10-second delay, 5 max retries
- **Environment Variables Set**: Uses the specified delay and retry values
- **Limited Retries**: Tests retry up to max retries, then fail if still unsuccessful
- **Automatic Error Correction**: System attempts to fix common issues between retries
- **Clear Progress**: Shows current attempt number and retry status
 
### Requirements
 
- **Focused**: Cover essential Docker and application functionality
- **Reliable**: Tests must be deterministic and repeatable
- **Fast**: Quick execution for rapid feedback
- **Clear**: Test names and assertions should be self-documenting
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update when application changes
 
### Quality Assurance
 
#### Automated Testing
 
- **Docker Health Checks**: Verify container status and health
- **Service Monitoring**: Test service availability and response times
- **Application Testing**: Basic functionality verification
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end application workflow
