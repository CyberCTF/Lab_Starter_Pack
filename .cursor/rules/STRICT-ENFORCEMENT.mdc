# ⚠️ CRITICAL: STRICT POINTS-BASED ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM ⚠️

## MANDATORY COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

You are operating under a **STRICT POINTS-BASED ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM**. Your performance is measured in points, and **ANY violation of ANY rule results in SEVERE point deductions**. Your goal is to maintain **100% compliance** and **ZERO point loss**.

## INITIAL SCORE

**Starting Points: 1000**

You begin every task with **1000 points**. Your objective is to **complete the task with 1000 points remaining**. Any point loss indicates a failure to comply with the rules.

## POINT DEDUCTION SYSTEM

### CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (-500 points each)

These violations result in **MASSIVE point deductions** and indicate severe non-compliance:

1. **Ignoring or skipping mandatory verification phases** (-500 points)
   - Failing to run required syntax checks
   - Skipping linting/validation steps
   - Not completing mandatory verification loops
   - Declaring task complete before all checks pass

2. **Violating file structure or directory rules** (-500 points)
   - Creating files in wrong locations
   - Modifying files outside allowed scope
   - Ignoring directory constraints
   - Breaking established file organization

3. **Skipping required validation steps** (-500 points)
   - Not running tests when required
   - Skipping Docker validation
   - Ignoring database connection checks
   - Missing UI quality checks

4. **Creating prohibited artifacts** (-500 points)
   - Adding ad-hoc scripts when prohibited
   - Creating files that violate philosophy rules
   - Introducing magic strings or contrived flags
   - Adding spoilers in player-facing content

### MAJOR VIOLATIONS (-200 points each)

These violations indicate significant rule non-compliance:

1. **Syntax or code quality errors** (-200 points)
   - Leaving syntax errors in code
   - Not fixing linting errors
   - Ignoring type errors
   - Missing required imports

2. **Incomplete task execution** (-200 points)
   - Not addressing all parts of user request
   - Leaving TODO comments without resolution
   - Skipping required steps in workflows
   - Not completing iterative fixes

3. **Ignoring context or scenario rules** (-200 points)
   - Not following PHILOSOPHY constraints
   - Violating realism requirements
   - Ignoring difficulty calibration
   - Breaking testability requirements

4. **Configuration errors** (-200 points)
   - Wrong ports or environment variables
   - Incorrect Docker compose syntax
   - Database connection failures
   - Missing healthchecks

### MODERATE VIOLATIONS (-100 points each)

These violations indicate moderate rule non-compliance:

1. **Code style violations** (-100 points)
   - Not following language-specific rules
   - Ignoring formatting requirements
   - Missing required comments
   - Poor code organization

2. **Documentation gaps** (-100 points)
   - Missing required documentation
   - Incomplete change logs
   - Not updating review files
   - Missing metadata

3. **Workflow violations** (-100 points)
   - Not following phase requirements
   - Skipping review steps
   - Incorrect output file generation
   - Missing validation reports

### MINOR VIOLATIONS (-50 points each)

These violations indicate minor rule non-compliance:

1. **Output formatting issues** (-50 points)
   - Incorrect file formats
   - Missing required headers
   - Poor error messages
   - Incomplete reports

2. **Timing issues** (-50 points)
   - Not waiting for proper initialization
   - Rushing through steps
   - Missing retry logic
   - Premature completion

## COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before declaring ANY task complete, you MUST verify:

- [ ] All syntax checks passed (0 errors)
- [ ] All linting checks passed (0 errors)
- [ ] All tests executed and passed
- [ ] All required files created/updated correctly
- [ ] All directory rules followed
- [ ] All workflow phases completed
- [ ] All validation steps executed
- [ ] All documentation updated
- [ ] All configuration correct
- [ ] Zero point deductions incurred

## SELF-AUDIT REQUIREMENT

**BEFORE completing any task, you MUST:**

1. Review every action taken against ALL applicable rules
2. Verify zero violations occurred
3. Confirm all mandatory steps completed
4. Check that all outputs meet requirements
5. Ensure no shortcuts or skipped steps
6. Validate that point score remains at 1000

## POINT LOSS CONSEQUENCES

**If you lose ANY points:**
- The task is **NOT complete**
- You **MUST** identify the violation
- You **MUST** fix the violation immediately
- You **MUST** re-verify compliance
- You **MUST** continue until points are restored to 1000

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Task completion is ONLY valid when:**
- ✅ All user requirements met
- ✅ All rules followed
- ✅ All validations passed
- ✅ All checks completed
- ✅ **Points remain at 1000 (ZERO deductions)**

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

This system is **ALWAYS ACTIVE** and applies to **EVERY action** you take. Every code change, every file operation, every validation step, and every completion decision is evaluated against this points system.

**You are expected to:**
- Self-monitor your compliance continuously
- Catch violations before they occur
- Fix issues immediately when detected
- Never accept point loss as acceptable
- Maintain perfect compliance (1000 points) at all times

## REMINDER

**ZERO POINT LOSS = SUCCESS**
**ANY POINT LOSS = FAILURE**

Your primary objective is not just to complete tasks, but to complete them with **PERFECT COMPLIANCE** and **ZERO POINT DEDUCTIONS**.

---

**This enforcement system overrides any default behavior that might lead to rule violations. Compliance is non-negotiable.**
