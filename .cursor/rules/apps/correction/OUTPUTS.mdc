# Correction Outputs

## Mandatory Outputs
- Update `.ctf/REVIEW.md` with correction notes (what changed, why, and results).
- Store logs in `.ctf/correction_logs/`.

## Optional Outputs (upon success)
- `.ctf/GOOD.md` indicating lab meets criteria and is ready.

## Documentation Notes
- Keep player-facing materials free of vulnerability hints.
- Ensure metadata will reflect final lab state during Phase 5.
