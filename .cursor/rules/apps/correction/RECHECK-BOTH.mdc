# Correction Recheck on Dev and Prod Compose

## Mandatory Behavior
- After applying fixes per `.ctf/REVIEW.md`, re-run the full validation against BOTH:
  - Root `docker-compose.yml` (prod)
  - `build/docker-compose.dev.yml` (dev)
- Ensure parity: same services, ports, healthchecks; only dev conveniences may differ (volumes, hot reload).
- Only when both pass and pytest (including flag extraction) passes, append success to `.ctf/REVIEW.md`; otherwise, record failures with precise categories.
