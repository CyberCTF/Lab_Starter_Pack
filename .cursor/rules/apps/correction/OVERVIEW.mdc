# Correction Phase Overview

## Purpose
- Apply fixes based on `.ctf/REVIEW.md` findings to produce a high-quality lab.
- Keep changes scoped to `build/` and `tests/`; do not alter `.ctf/` except to append outcomes.

## Scope
- Dockerfiles, compose files, healthchecks
- Database init scripts and privileges
- Application code and UI
- Tests and test configuration

## Coordination
- Use outputs from Review (`.ctf/REVIEW.md`, `.ctf/review_logs/`) to drive corrections.
- When complete, run tests and produce final outputs per the correction outputs spec.
