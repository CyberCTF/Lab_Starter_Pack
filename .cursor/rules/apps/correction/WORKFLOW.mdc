# Correction Workflow

## Steps
1. Ingest findings from `.ctf/REVIEW.md` and categorize (Docker/Compose, DB, App/UI, Tests, Docs).
2. Implement fixes in `build/` and `tests/` according to development/run rules.
3. Rerun tests with env-driven retries; log each attempt and status.
4. Update `.ctf/REVIEW.md` with corrections summary; if all pass, create `.ctf/GOOD.md`.

## Constraints
- No changes to `.ctf/` inputs except appending results.
- Respect Compose V2, env-driven ports, and healthchecks.
- Enforce DB init order and GRANT separation.
- Maintain UI professionalism (no warnings), follow design system.

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass reliably.
- Containers healthy and ports correct.
- Flag extractable and appropriate.
- Documentation coherent and professional.
