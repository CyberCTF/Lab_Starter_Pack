# Dev/Prod Compose Parity and Path Rules

## Path Correctness (when dev compose is inside build/)
- If `build/docker-compose.dev.yml` lives inside `build/`, service build contexts MUST be relative to `build/`:
  - Correct: `context: ./web`, `dockerfile: Dockerfile`
  - Incorrect: `context: ./build/web` (double `build`)
- Mounts and volumes must also be relative: `./database/init` not `./build/database/init`.

## Port Consistency (Compose V2)
- Use env-driven identical internal/external ports:
  - Web: `${WEB_PORT:-3206}:3206`
  - DB: `${DB_HOST_PORT:-3207}:3207`
- Services must actually listen on those internal ports (e.g., MySQL `--port=3207`, Apache `Listen 3206`).

## Dev/Prod Parity
- Dev (`build/docker-compose.dev.yml`) and prod (`docker-compose.yml`) must define the same services, ports, and healthchecks (only dev features like volumes/hot-reload may differ).
- Both files must use Compose V2 (no `version:` key).

## Healthchecks
- Web: HTTP health endpoint on `3206` using `curl -fsS http://localhost:3206/health` (or equivalent).
- DB (MySQL 8): `mysqladmin ping -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"`
  - Do not pass `-h 127.0.0.1` inside container (use socket/localhost defaults).
  - Provide `start_period: 30s` to allow initialization before first check.

## Security and Users
- Web and DB should run as non-root users (e.g., `user: "33:33"` for Apache/PHP, `user: "999:999"` for MySQL official image) where appropriate.
