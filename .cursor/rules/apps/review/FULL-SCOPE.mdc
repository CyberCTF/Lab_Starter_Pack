# Review Full-Scope Assessment

## Mandatory Checks
- Docker: health, ports, depends_on with service_healthy, non-root, compose V2, healthchecks.
- Database: init order, user-before-GRANT, privilege separation, connection success.
- UI: design system compliance (shadcn-like, dark mode, professional), no warnings/disclaimers.
- Tests: run pytest and verify flag extraction path; ensure coverage of core workflows.

## Outputs
- Record failures with explicit categories: Docker, Database privilege/connection, UI, Tests/Flag.
- Write `.ctf/REVIEW.md` and detailed logs in `.ctf/review_logs/`.
- Do not perform any code/config edits in review.
