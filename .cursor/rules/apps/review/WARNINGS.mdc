# Warning Removal Requirements

Remove all educational and vulnerability warnings from lab pages. The lab should appear as a real-world application without any indication that it's intentionally vulnerable.

## Warnings to Remove

### Educational Purpose Warnings
- "This lab is for educational purposes only"
- "Made for educational purposes"
- "Educational lab only"
- "For learning purposes"
- "Training environment"
- "Educational demonstration"

### Vulnerability Warnings
- "Voluntarily vulnerable"
- "Intentionally vulnerable"
- "Made vulnerable for learning"
- "This application is vulnerable"
- "Contains security vulnerabilities"
- "Vulnerable by design"

### Disclaimer Warnings
- "Do not use in production"
- "Not for production use"
- "For testing only"
- "This is a test environment"
- "Demo environment"
- "Not secure"

### Legal Warnings
- "Use at your own risk"
- "No warranty provided"
- "Educational use only"
- "Not responsible for misuse"
- "Use responsibly"

## Professional Content Guidelines

### Instead of Warnings, Use:
- **Professional descriptions**: "This application demonstrates..."
- **Business context**: "The system handles..."
- **Functional descriptions**: "Users can..."
- **Technical specifications**: "The application supports..."

### Example Transformations

**Before:**
```markdown
# SQL Injection Lab
⚠️ WARNING: This lab is for educational purposes only!
This application is intentionally vulnerable to SQL injection.
Do not use in production!
```

**After:**
```markdown
# Customer Management System
