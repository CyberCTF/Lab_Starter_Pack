# Help Content Guidelines

The content of the lab should not help the user find the flag or answer the questions. The lab should provide a realistic challenge without giving away the solution.

## Help Content Requirements

### 1. No Direct Assistance
- **No Flag Hints**: Do not provide hints about where to find the flag
- **No Exploitation Guidance**: Do not explain how to exploit the vulnerability
- **No Solution Paths**: Do not outline the steps to solve the lab
- **No Answer Clues**: Do not provide clues about the expected answers

### 2. Realistic Business Context
- **Professional Documentation**: Provide only business-relevant information
- **Functional Descriptions**: Focus on what the application does, not how it works
- **User Manuals**: Include only standard user documentation
- **API Documentation**: Provide only necessary API information
