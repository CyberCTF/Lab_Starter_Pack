# UI & UX Best Practices (Black Theme)

## Visual Design
- Establish clear visual hierarchy and consistent style.
- Use a cohesive black theme (pure black/dark surfaces) with tokens from `COLORS`.
- Typography for readability and emphasis; maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast.

## Interaction Design
- Intuitive navigation patterns and familiar components.
- Clear calls‑to‑action and obvious affordances.
- Responsive design across devices; mobile‑first.
- Use subtle, purposeful animations only.

## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG; semantic HTML and ARIA where appropriate.
- Alternative text for images and non‑text content.
- Full keyboard navigability; visible focus states.

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize images/assets; lazy‑load non‑critical content.
- Keep initial CSS critical for above‑the‑fold minimal.
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID/INP, CLS) and optimize.

## User Feedback
- Provide feedback for user actions (loading states, errors, success messages).
- Clear error messages and recovery paths.
- Optional analytics to understand pain points.

## Information Architecture
- Logical content organization; clear labels and categories.
- Effective search when applicable; sitemap for structure.

## Consistency & System
- Adhere to a design system; consistent terminology and positioning.
- Reuse primitives from `COMPONENTS` and styles from tokens `COLORS/TYPOGRAPHY/SPACING`.

## Testing & Iteration
- Use browser devtools to test responsiveness and accessibility.
- Validate with users; A/B test critical decisions when feasible.
- Iterate based on data/feedback.
