# Lab Development and Directory Structure for Build Folder
 
You are a senior web developer tasked with creating a complete lab directly in the `/build` folder based on provided files.
 
Your goal is to **analyze** the template folder, detect the technology stack, adapt to its conventions, and fully implement the scenario as a realistic business application with one vulnerability realistic **directly within the build directory structure**.
 
## Directory Naming Convention
 
The lab directory should have a name that clearly identifies the vulnerability type and is appropriate for the specific vulnerability being demonstrated.
 
### Examples
 
- `sql-injection-basic`
- `xss-stored-payload`
- `file-upload-rce`
- `xxe-internal-entities`
- `ssrf-localhost-bypass`
- `ldap-injection-auth-bypass`
 
### Directory Structure for Build Folder
 
```
tests/
docker-compose.yml
build/
│ 
├── docker-compose.dev.yml
├── web/ (or other service type)
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── src/ (application code)
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── publish.yml
└── config/ (configuration files)
```
 
### Requirements for Build Folder Structure
 
- All lab components must be created directly within the `/build` directory
- Service directories (web, api, database) should be created as subdirectories of `/build`
- Configuration files should be placed at the root of `/build` or in a dedicated `config/` subdirectory
- Must be descriptive of the vulnerability being demonstrated
- Should be easily searchable and identifiable
- Must follow kebab-case convention for service names
 
## Development Best Practices
 
### Code Organization
 
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep application logic separate from vulnerability code
- **Modular Design**: Use clear module boundaries
- **Configuration Management**: Externalize configuration settings
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without revealing sensitive information
 
### Security Considerations
 
- **Realistic Vulnerabilities**: Create vulnerabilities that mirror real-world scenarios
- **No Obvious Indicators**: Avoid making vulnerabilities too obvious
- **Professional Appearance**: Maintain realistic business application appearance
- **Data Sanitization**: Implement proper input validation where appropriate
 
### Application Architecture
 
- **Technology Stack**: Choose appropriate technologies for the vulnerability type
- **Database Design**: Create realistic database schemas
- **API Design**: Implement RESTful APIs where applicable
- **Frontend Integration**: Create professional-looking user interfaces
 
### File Organization for Build Folder
 
- **Source Code**: Place application code in service-specific directories (e.g., `web/src/`, `api/src/`)
- **Configuration**: Keep config files at the root of `/build` or in `config/` subdirectory
- **Docker Files**: Place Dockerfiles in their respective service directories
- **Docker Compose**: Keep docker-compose files at the root of `/build`

 
### Directory Creation Strategy
 
- **Direct Implementation**: Create all lab components directly within the `/build` directory
- **Service Isolation**: Each service (web, database, api) should have its own subdirectory
- **Flat Structure**: Avoid nested build directories - keep the structure flat and accessible
 
### Service Organization
 
- **Web Services**: Create in `/build/web/` with Dockerfile and source code
- **Database Services**: Create in `/build/database/` with initialization scripts
- **API Services**: Create in `/build/api/` with endpoint implementations
- **Configuration**: Centralize in `/build/config/` or at root level
 
### Development Workflow
 
1. **Analyze Template**: Understand the existing structure and technology stack
2. **Create Services**: Build each service component in its respective directory
3. **Configure Integration**: Set up docker-compose for service orchestration
4. **Implement Vulnerability**: Add realistic security flaws within the application logic
