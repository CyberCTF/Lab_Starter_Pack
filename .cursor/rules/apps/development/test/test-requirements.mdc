# Test Requirements and Coverage

## Test Coverage

### Docker Container Tests
- Verify containers are running and accessible
- Test container health status
- Validate port accessibility

### Service Availability Tests
- Test that all required services are up and responding
- Verify service connectivity
- Check service health endpoints

### Application Functionality Tests
- Basic application features work correctly
- User interface elements function properly
- API endpoints respond correctly

### Port Configuration Tests
- Verify all required ports are open and accessible
- Test port mappings are correct
- Validate service listening on correct ports

### Database Connectivity Tests
- Test database connections work properly
- Validate database initialization
- Test basic database operations

## Test Structure

### Test Organization
- **Docker Tests**: Container status, health checks, port accessibility
- **Service Tests**: Web application, database, and other services availability
- **Application Tests**: Basic functionality, user interface, API endpoints
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end application workflow

### Test Requirements

#### Focused Coverage
- Cover essential Docker and application functionality
- Test critical user workflows
- Validate security and performance basics

#### Deterministic Results
- Tests must be repeatable and reliable
- No race conditions or timing dependencies
- Consistent test environment setup

#### Clear Assertions
- Test names should be self-documenting
- Assertion messages should be descriptive
- Error output should be actionable

#### Fast Execution
- Quick feedback on Docker and application status
- Minimize unnecessary waits and delays
- Optimize test data setup and teardown

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing
- **Docker Health Checks**: Verify container status and health
- **Service Monitoring**: Test service availability and response times
- **Application Testing**: Basic functionality verification
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end application workflow
