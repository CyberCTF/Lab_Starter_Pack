## Build Directory Structure

```
build/
├── docker-compose.dev.yml
└── [service-type]/ (adapt based on project context)
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── [dependency-files] (based on technology stack)
    └── src/
        └── application files
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Service Configuration
- **Main Service**: Primary application container (adapt name and type based on project)
- **Database Service**: Data persistence (if needed by project context)
- **Port Mapping**: Expose necessary ports (adapt based on application requirements)
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration management (adapt based on project needs)
- **Volume Mounts**: Data persistence and development (adapt paths based on project structure)

### Health Checks
- **Main Service**: Appropriate health check endpoint (adapt based on service type)
- **Database**: Connection validation (if database is used)
- **Interval**: 30 seconds (adjust based on application requirements)
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds (adjust based on application response time)
- **Retries**: 3 attempts (adjust based on reliability requirements)

### Security Considerations
- **Non-root User**: Run containers as non-root (adapt user creation based on base image)
- **Resource Limits**: Set memory and CPU limits (adapt based on application requirements)
- **Network Isolation**: Use custom networks (adapt based on service communication needs)
- **Secret Management**: Use Docker secrets for sensitive data (adapt based on security requirements)

### Development Features
- **Hot Reload**: Source code changes trigger automatic rebuilds (adapt based on technology stack)
- **Volume Mounts**: Local source code mounted into container (adapt paths based on project structure)
- **Debug Mode**: Enhanced logging and error reporting (adapt based on debugging needs)
- **Database Access**: Direct database port exposure for debugging (if database is used)
- **Development Tools**: Additional debugging and development utilities (adapt based on technology stack)

## Docker Hub Integration
- **Image Repository**: Adapt based on project context and organization
- **Tagging Strategy**: Adapt based on deployment requirements
- **Automated Builds**: Configure based on CI/CD pipeline
- **Multi-architecture**: Support for different platforms (adapt based on target platforms)

## Context Adaptation Guidelines

### Technology Stack Detection
- **Analyze project files** to determine the appropriate technology stack
- **Adapt Dockerfile** based on detected language/framework (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
- **Configure dependencies** based on detected package managers (npm, pip, composer, etc.)
- **Set appropriate base images** based on technology requirements

### Project Structure Adaptation
- **Service naming** should reflect the actual project purpose
- **Port configuration** should match the application's actual ports
- **Volume mounts** should align with the project's directory structure
- **Environment variables** should be relevant to the specific application

### Database Integration
- **Include database service** only if the project requires data persistence
- **Configure appropriate database** based on project requirements (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- **Set up proper database credentials** and connection strings
- **Configure database volumes** for data persistence

### Security Adaptation
- **User permissions** should be appropriate for the application type
- **Resource limits** should be based on actual application requirements
- **Network configuration** should support the application's communication needs
- **Secret management** should handle the specific sensitive data of the project
