# CyberCTF Metadata and Question Structure

## Metadata Requirements

**Input:** Lab directory + `/.ctf`  
**Artefact:** `/.ctf/metadata.md` or `.json`

Create a comprehensive metadata file containing all information required for the CyberCTF website.

### Metadata Structure

#### 1. Basic Information
```json
{
  "title": "SQL Injection in Customer Management System",
  "description": "A realistic customer management system vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Learn to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.",
  "difficulty": 2,
  "estimated_time": "45 minutes",
  "prerequisites": [
    "Basic understanding of SQL",
    "Knowledge of web application security",
    "Familiarity with browser developer tools"
  ],
  "skills_learned": [
    "SQL injection identification",
    "Payload construction",
    "Database enumeration",
    "Data extraction techniques",
    "Web application testing methodology"
  ],
  "flag": "admin:5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592"
}
```

#### 2. Questions Structure
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the admin user's password hash?",
      "hint": "Try using SQL injection in the search functionality",
      "solution": "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592"
    },
    {
      "question": "How many users are in the database?",
      "hint": "Use UNION SELECT to count records",
      "solution": "15"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Difficulty Levels

#### 1. Easy (1)
- **Description**: Basic vulnerability exploitation
- **Requirements**: Minimal technical knowledge
- **Examples**: Simple SQL injection, basic XSS
- **Time**: 15-30 minutes

#### 2. Medium (2)
- **Description**: Moderate complexity exploitation
- **Requirements**: Some technical knowledge
- **Examples**: Advanced SQL injection, stored XSS
- **Time**: 30-60 minutes

#### 3. Hard (3)
- **Description**: Complex exploitation techniques
- **Requirements**: Good technical knowledge
- **Examples**: Blind SQL injection, advanced XSS
- **Time**: 60-120 minutes

#### 4. Expert (4)
- **Description**: Advanced exploitation techniques
- **Requirements**: Expert technical knowledge
- **Examples**: Time-based blind SQL injection, DOM-based XSS
- **Time**: 120+ minutes

### Question Guidelines

#### 1. Question Requirements
- **At least one question** to find the flag
- **Guiding questions** if the lab is too easy
- **Clear and specific** questions
- **Realistic scenarios** that match the lab context

#### 2. Question Structure
```json
{
  "question": "What is the admin user's password hash?",
  "hint": "Try using SQL injection in the search functionality",
  "solution": "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592"
}
```

#### 3. Hint Guidelines
- **Helpful but not obvious**: Provide guidance without giving away the answer
- **Technical direction**: Point users toward the right approach
- **Progressive hints**: Start with general hints, get more specific
- **Realistic context**: Hints should match real-world scenarios
